# Changelog

## 0.1.126 — 2026-07-09

### Fix

- **Deploy** — do not start the Next.js web server when the internal API fails to become ready; exit and let systemd restart instead of serving an empty library
- **Deploy** — align `/api` rewrite port with `MEDIA_INTERNAL_API_PORT` and verify the API responds after updates

## 0.1.125 — 2026-07-09

### Fix

- **Playback** — keep video playing when the browser tab loses focus; only save progress instead of pausing and killing the transcode
- **Playback** — stop exiting watch when HLS hits a growing playlist boundary; recover and continue instead of treating it as the end of the file
- **Playback** — preserve the current position on quality changes and auto-fallback instead of restarting from saved resume
- **Playback** — only mark transcodes complete with `#EXT-X-ENDLIST` when ffmpeg exits successfully, not on failure
- **Playback** — refresh the HLS manifest when returning to a foreground tab or when paused near the buffer edge
- **Playback** — stop orphaned ffmpeg sessions when switching from transcode to direct play

## 0.1.124 — 2026-07-09

### Fix

- **Playback** — fix scattered buffer dots on the scrubber by serving growing transcode playlists as VoD with `#EXT-X-ENDLIST` so hls.js loads segments sequentially instead of prefetching at the live edge
- **Playback** — poll the manifest before the buffer runs low so new segments are discovered during ongoing transcodes
- **Playback** — scrubber shows one contiguous buffered range from the playhead instead of disconnected islands ahead

## 0.1.123 — 2026-07-09

### Fix

- **Playback** — fix HLS stalling after the first buffer by loading segments sequentially from the buffer end instead of prefetching ahead of the playhead
- **Playback** — poll the growing transcode playlist and recover when playback stalls at the buffer edge
- **Playback** — stop killing the active ffmpeg transcode on seek or stream restart; only stop when leaving the title
- **Playback** — wait for four HLS segments before starting playback so the first buffer has enough runway

## 0.1.122 — 2026-07-09

### Fix

- **Playback** — fix HLS stalling at the first buffer edge caused by live-edge prefetch leaving gaps ahead of the playhead
- **Playback** — resume segment loading on waiting, playlist updates, and fragment errors instead of requiring a refresh

## 0.1.121 — 2026-07-09

### Fix

- **Playback** — stop HLS from stalling at the end of the first buffer; clearing seek state no longer kills the active transcode session mid-playback
- **Playback** — server waits for in-progress HLS segments instead of returning 404 while ffmpeg is still encoding
- **Playback** — hls.js keeps polling growing EVENT playlists for new segments

## 0.1.120 — 2026-07-09

### Fix

- **Playback** — stop buffering recoveries from jumping forward to a stale position instead of continuing where you were watching
- **Playback** — clear one-shot seek targets after stream restarts so later recoveries follow the live playhead

### TV

- **Playback** — commit scrub preview on blur and restart the stream when seeking outside the buffered range

## 0.1.119 — 2026-07-09

### Fix

- **Build** — remove duplicate import in TV watch view that broke the production Next.js build and left the site unstyled (CSS chunks returned 500)

## 0.1.118 — 2026-07-09

### Fix

- **Playback** — stop buffering recoveries from jumping to the end of the buffered range when the player briefly reports the buffer edge instead of the real playhead

### TV

- **Playback** — same stable-playhead restart fix on Android TV

## 0.1.117 — 2026-07-09

### Fix

- **Playback** — stop stream restarts during buffering from jumping back to the saved resume point instead of the current playhead

### TV

- **Playback** — same resume-position restart fix on Android TV

### UI

- **Posters** — prefetch carousel artwork on row hover and scroll so off-screen tiles decode sooner

## 0.1.116 — 2026-07-08

### TV

- **Playback** — watch scrubber and subtitle/quality menus mirror the desktop player (popover menus, ghost transport controls, preview-then-commit scrubbing)
- **Playback** — scrubber shows the saved resume position immediately when opening a title instead of creeping from zero

## 0.1.115 — 2026-07-08

### TV

- **Startup** — keep the native splash up until auth and page content are ready; homepage-style animated MEDIA! hero on launch
- **Playback** — clearer mid-stream buffering (scrubber buffer state, no settings chrome flash while rebuffering)
- **UI** — center sidebar logo in the nav rail

## 0.1.114 — 2026-07-08

### TV

- **Playback** — prefer native direct play on Android TV; fix black-screen overlay during loading; sync subtitles reliably and apply saved styles at start
- **Playback** — Back dismisses controls whenever they are visible; exit only when controls are hidden
- **UI** — center sidebar logo; MEDIA! startup splash until the web UI is ready
- **Android TV app** — launcher icon matches in-app branding; voice search via system recognizer (no mic permission)

### Fix

- **Playback** — do not treat ExoPlayer idle state as buffering on native TV


### Fix

- **Settings** — stop MEDIA! before prefix rebuilds, handle systemd restarts cleanly, log to `restart.log`, and ignore stale `MEDIA_PUBLIC_PREFIX` env

## 0.1.112 — 2026-07-08

### Fix

- **Reverse proxy** — clearing the public prefix now triggers a clean web rebuild so `/reel` does not stick in asset URLs
- **Home** — reduce font flicker on first load by prioritizing Inter over poster preloads and fading the hero title in once fonts are ready

## 0.1.111 — 2026-07-08

### Fix

- **Reverse proxy** — pass `MEDIA_PUBLIC_PREFIX` through Turbo builds so `basePath` is applied

## 0.1.110 — 2026-07-08

### Settings

- **Reverse proxy** — editable public URL prefix in Settings; save rebuilds (when changed) and restarts MEDIA!

## 0.1.109 — 2026-07-08

### Fix

- **Reverse proxy** — remove gateway `?__p=` mode; use a proper subpath proxy instead (see `docs/reverse-proxy.md`)

## 0.1.108 — 2026-07-08

### Fix

- **Reverse proxy** — gateway routing reads runtime `MEDIA_GATEWAY_PREFIX` and handles Apache stripping `/reel` to `/`

## 0.1.107 — 2026-07-08

### Fix

- **Reverse proxy** — gateway builds now emit `/_next` assets through `/reel?__p=…` (webpack build + HTML rewrite)

## 0.1.106 — 2026-07-08

### Fix

- **Reverse proxy** — gateway URL mode for broken Apache subpath proxies (`/reel?__p=…`); see `docs/gateway-proxy.md`
- **TV** — subtitle settings menu as a side panel with working D-pad navigation; smaller sidebar logo

## 0.1.105 — 2026-07-07

### Fix

- **Images** — allowlist `/api/images/**` in Next.js `localPatterns` so `/_next/image` no longer returns 400 for poster URLs
- **Images** — let the image optimizer fetch cached artwork from localhost on password-protected servers
- **Theme music** — guard the media-banner waveform canvas when layout is too narrow (fixes `roundRect` negative radius crash)

## 0.1.104 — 2026-07-07

### Performance

- **Images** — serve posters, backdrops, and stills through the Next.js image optimizer (AVIF/WebP via sharp) instead of full-size JPEGs
- **Images** — shared `MediaImage` component with responsive `sizes`; prefetch and playback preload warm optimized `/_next/image` URLs

### TV

- **Images** — TV posters and episode stills keep eager priority loading through `next/image`

## 0.1.103 — 2026-07-07

### Performance

- **Images** — eager-load above-fold posters, preload artwork on hover/TV focus, and warm media JSON before navigation
- **TV home** — server-seed home rows so posters render immediately instead of waiting on a client fetch spinner
- **Media pages** — eager-load hero backdrop and poster for faster first paint

### Fix

- **Deploy** — migrate legacy `~/.startup/reel` to `start-prod.sh`, verify Next.js is serving pages after update, and remove stale static export output on build
- **API proxy** — keep runtime `/api` rewrites on port 8097 instead of baking the ephemeral prerender port into the build
- **Next.js** — rename `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts` (Next 16 convention)

## 0.1.102 — 2026-07-07

### Fix

- **Media pages** — force clean `.next` output on build and fail if prerendered HTML still contains loading skeletons; wipe web build cache on server deploy
- **Build** — disable turbopack filesystem build cache to avoid stale prerender shells across releases

### Performance

- **Media pages** — revalidate ISR cache by tag when a new TV episode is scanned so season lists refresh without waiting for the 5-minute TTL

## 0.1.101 — 2026-07-07

### Fix

- **Media pages** — remove `loading.tsx` from static ISR routes so prerendered hero HTML is visible immediately instead of a Suspense skeleton shell that waits for client hydration
- **Build** — verify pre-rendered media HTML includes hero markup and warn when loading shells leak into static output

## 0.1.100 — 2026-07-07

### Performance

- **App** — adopt Next.js App Router best practices: server-fetched home and list pages with ISR (`revalidate` 1 min), route-level `loading.tsx` for instant `<Link>` navigation, and shared server API helpers
- **Media pages** — async RSC page with `loading.tsx`, server hero, Suspense-streamed related titles, and ISR caching (no client skeletons or hard navigation)

### Fix

- **Media pages** — show sign-in prompt instead of a blank page when SSR cannot read a password-protected library; fix internal API auth for related titles and other SSR paths
- **Search** — wrap `useSearchParams` in Suspense to avoid client rendering bailout
- **Middleware** — redirect legacy `/favorites/?type=` query URLs to canonical paths

### UI

- **App** — global `error.tsx` recovery UI; route metadata titles on home, library, favorites, settings, and other main routes

## 0.1.99 — 2026-07-07

### Fix

- **Media pages** — server-render the hero in RSC so navigation never flashes a client skeleton; tighten internal API auth for SSR on password-protected servers

## 0.1.98 — 2026-07-07

### Fix

- **Media pages** — stop loading skeletons on password-protected servers by allowing Next's localhost internal API reads; seed hero data from server props and prefetch cache on client navigation
- **Deploy** — clear build-time API env vars in `start-prod.sh` so production does not proxy to the prerender port

## 0.1.97 — 2026-07-07

### Performance

- **Media pages** — pre-render all library titles at build time via `generateStaticParams`; new titles added after deploy still generate on first visit with ISR (`revalidate` 5 min)

## 0.1.96 — 2026-07-07

### Fix

- **Media pages** — ISR routes now server-render the hero instead of showing a skeleton while client JS loads; `useSearchParams` is limited to legacy `/media/?id=` URLs

## 0.1.95 — 2026-07-07

### Performance

- **Media pages** — run Next.js in server mode with ISR (`revalidate` 5 min), prefetch on poster hover/focus, and split related-title loading so the hero renders without waiting
- **Deploy** — serve the web UI from Next standalone; Fastify runs API-only on an internal port (`scripts/start-prod.sh`)

### Fix

- **API** — stop Next trailing-slash redirects from breaking `/api/stream` and other backend routes
- **Continue watching** — prune orphaned watch-progress rows when episodes/files are gone; hide the home row when empty
- **Subtitles** — fix appearance preview sizing, keep captions visible while the appearance panel is open, and only show background opacity when a background is selected

### TV

- **Android TV** — center the home-screen banner icon and wordmark
- **Subtitles** — match new default appearance styles in ExoPlayer

## 0.1.94 — 2026-07-07

### Fix

- **Subtitles** — sync web captions to live HLS playback time (not stale resume offset), reset offset on title change, and hide subtitles until the video actually starts playing

## 0.1.93 — 2026-07-07

### Fix

- **Subtitles** — sync HLS captions to absolute playback time on resume and seek-restart; hide them while watch menus are open and keep them below the controls chrome

## 0.1.92 — 2026-07-07

### Fix

- **Subtitles** — render web captions from parsed VTT timed to playback (reliable on HLS) and show clear errors when subtitle loads fail

## 0.1.91 — 2026-07-07

### Fix

- **Navigation** — parse entity IDs from the browser URL so `/media/7/` and other path routes work with static export (no more “Invalid media” flash)

- **ExoPlayer** — subtitle appearance styling via `setSubtitleStyles` bridge and smoother track hot-swap
- **ExoPlayer** — enable HDR window mode earlier when stream metadata reports HDR

## 0.1.88 — 2026-07-07

### Fix

- **Subtitles** — restore web subtitle display after playback reloads and fix HLS resume timing by shifting VTT cues to the stream offset
- **Subtitles** — prefetch and cache tracks for instant selection; native hot-swap only applies when ExoPlayer is active

### TV

- **Subtitles** — pass timeline offset to native subtitle URLs so cues stay in sync during transcoded playback

## 0.1.87 — 2026-07-07

### UI

- **Watch player** — subtitle appearance opens in a modal over the video from the subtitles menu instead of Settings

## 0.1.86 — 2026-07-07

### Fix

- **TV playback** — stop audio when leaving watch for home by tearing down native/web playback before navigation

### TV

- **Subtitles** — hot-swap tracks without a full player restart via a new native `setSubtitles` bridge
- **Subtitles** — full-screen settings menus with vertical D-pad navigation, section labels, and a back header
- **Subtitles** — keep the track menu open after selection so the active track stays visible

## 0.1.85 — 2026-07-06

### UI

- **Desktop nav** — logo without the dark tile background, tighter crop, and sizing aligned with the search bar

## 0.1.84 — 2026-07-06

### UI

- **Home** — full recently added card is clickable, not just the Open button

## 0.1.83 — 2026-07-06

### Fix

- **Android TV 4K playback** — remove tunneled decoding that hung on some panels; 4K titles no longer stuck on "Loading video..."
- **Android TV HDR** — apply HDR window mode only after the player is ready

### TV

- **Back navigation** — one Back exits watch (unless controls were just opened); replace history so Back from the title page does not reopen playback
- **Side nav** — larger transparent logo without the dark tile background

## 0.1.82 — 2026-07-06

### Fix

- **Android TV HDR** — pass HDR through to the panel on native direct play; enable tunneling, HDR window mode, and stop the WebView overlay from dimming video during playback or buffering

### TV

- **4K SD content** — softer upscaling on 4K panels (native GPU upscale for SD, WebView soften fallback, Lanczos when transcoding)

### Playback

- **Transcode** — use Lanczos scaling when upscaling during transcode

### Fix

- **Playback** — clear buffering state when the video reaches `canplay`
- **Subtitles** — TV cue size respects user appearance settings instead of a fixed size

## 0.1.74 — 2026-07-06

- **Back** — layered dismiss (menus → controls → exit) via web handler before history back
- **Pairing** — robust login token parsing and trimmed password on pair screen

### TV watch player
- **Controls** — scrubber above transport row; Up/Down navigation matches layout; Quality no longer opens on Up
- **Seek** — left/right only skips when scrubber is focused; hidden controls reveal the bar instead of skipping
- **Back** — first press closes open menus or hides controls; exit only when nothing is open
- **Picture** — remove page gradient dimming during native playback

### Server
- **Auth** — login returns session token in JSON for native TV pairing

### Playback
- **Native TV** — prefer direct play again; HLS remux stays as error fallback only

## 0.1.67 — 2026-07-05

### Playback
- **Native TV** — HLS remux for SD/HD MKV/WebM on ExoPlayer to reduce stutter; keep 4K on direct play

- **TV playback** — restore native direct play instead of forcing MKV→HLS remux on every title
- **TV menus** — fix broken subtitle/quality selection borders (solid focus borders instead of inset shadows); remove backdrop blur from menus; lighter focus transitions

## 0.1.63 — 2026-07-04

### Playback
- **Seamless streaming** — MKV/WebM remux with annex-B bitstream filters and cleaner timestamps; HLS waits for two segments before start; transcode uses `veryfast` + `genpts`; pick transcode tier near source resolution; larger read buffers and HLS buffers
- **Android TV native** — remux MKV/WebM to HLS for smoother ExoPlayer playback; explicit MIME types for container formats; native error fallback to remux before transcode

### TV
- **Home screen** — smoother navigation: instant scroll, lighter poster effects, lazy-loaded images, layout containment

### TV
- **Watch player** — pressing Up no longer shows a focus border around the video when hiding controls

## 0.1.57 — 2026-07-04

### UI
- **Playback scrubber** — cleaner progress bar and thumb styling on desktop; TV scrubber gets a proper playhead dot instead of stretching on focus

## 0.1.56 — 2026-07-04

### Fix
- **Update script** — move trap handlers to top level and clear EXIT trap on success so `config_dir` is never unbound after a completed update

### UI
- **Lazy posters** — defer loading browse/search poster images until they scroll into view

### Dev
- **Actions-free releases** — drop the tag-triggered GitHub Actions workflow; publish releases locally with `pnpm release` (`gh` + CHANGELOG.md)
- **Updater tag detection** — check latest version via `git ls-remote` tags and CHANGELOG.md instead of relying on the GitHub Releases API

## 0.1.44 — 2026-07-04

### TV
- **Next episode autoplay** — countdown overlay when a TV episode ends, with play-now and cancel options
- **Continue Watching** — show the next episode in a series after the previous one is finished

- **Focus styling** — compact focus rings on buttons and chips so focused controls no longer overlap on Android TV

## 0.1.43 — 2026-07-04

### Android TV
- **Native video player** — ExoPlayer (Media3) decodes behind the Reel TV UI; keeps timeline, skip, quality, and subtitle controls
- **Session auth** — pass login cookies on all HLS/direct stream requests from the native player
- **Original quality** — play source resolution on TV (direct or remux); no 1080p cap when using native playback
- **Controls** — overlay fades out 3s after playback starts; Down on the remote brings it back

### Playback
- **HLS auth** — send session cookies on hls.js segment requests; auto-fallback to lower quality on fatal errors

### TV
- **Episode list scroll** — keep focused row in view on long seasons
- **Logout** — move sign-out directly under Search in the side rail

## 0.1.42 — 2026-07-04

## 0.1.40 — 2026-07-03

### Subtitles
- **OpenSubtitles search** — results sorted by download count (highest first)
- **OpenSubtitles downloads** — validate file content before saving; write cache file and verify on disk before inserting DB rows; keep downloads when list filtering runs
- **Playback** — load subtitle tracks via authenticated fetch (fixes dev cross-origin and auth); re-attach after stream reloads; preserve newly downloaded tracks when refreshing the menu

### Dev
- **`dev.sh`** — set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` so the web dev server talks to the API on `:8096`

## 0.1.39 — 2026-07-03

### Stability
- **Transcode cache cleanup** — removing HLS cache directories no longer crashes the server on `ENOTEMPTY`; kills orphan FFmpeg, retries removal, and isolates cleanup timer failures

## 0.1.38 — 2026-07-03

### UI
- **Subtitle menu** — show "None available" when a title has no subtitle tracks instead of "Off"

## 0.1.35 — 2026-07-03

### Theme music
- **Movie themes** — fetches theme songs from ThemerrDB (e.g. Star Wars) via yt-dlp; TV shows fall back to ThemerrDB when fanart.tv has no theme
- **Compressed cache** — downloaded themes re-encoded to 96 kbps MP3 to save disk space
- **Banner waveform** — transparent live audio visualization in the detail page hero while theme music plays
- **Autoplay** — muted-start playback and site-wide audio unlock so themes start without an extra click after navigating from the library

### Fixes
- **Shared build** — removed `node:path` from TV parser so web builds succeed on VPS

## 0.1.34 — 2026-07-03

### Settings

## 0.1.33 — 2026-07-03

### Features
- **Theme music** — Plex-style show/movie themes on detail pages with fade in/out; local `theme.mp3` in the media folder, or automatic fetch from fanart.tv when `fanart_api_key` is set in config

- **Resume labels** — media detail Play button shows “Resume at 12:34” when watch progress exists; TV episode rows show the same
- **Continue button** — homepage hero button shows the movie or series title (e.g. “Continue Breaking Bad”)

## 0.1.28 — 2026-07-03

### Playback
- **Universal audio compatibility** — any non-AAC/MP3 audio (TrueHD, DTS, AC3, FLAC, PCM, etc.) is automatically converted to AAC on Original quality via remux or transcode
- **HEVC remux** — H.264/HEVC video stays at source quality while audio is converted; falls back to transcoded H.264 on browsers without HEVC support
- **Resume fix** — resuming playback no longer flashes 0:00; player seeks to the saved position before starting
- Smarter audio track selection (default track, skips commentary) and standardized AAC output at 48 kHz

### Playback
- **Timeline hover preview** — show a timestamp tooltip when hovering or scrubbing the progress bar

- Favorites row on home and quick-access card in Library Decks

### Playback
- **Original quality by default** — playback no longer auto-switches to transcoded quality for unsupported audio codecs
- **Faster direct play** — skip redundant ffprobe when scan metadata is available; larger read buffers; seek-on-release scrubbing; `preload="auto"`; earlier resume positioning
- Store TV episode codec/dimensions at scan time and backfill on rescan

### Updates
- **Upgrade progress fix** — in-app update banner no longer shows all steps complete immediately; log phase inference uses the current update session only

## 0.1.25 — 2026-07-03

### Playback
- **Seek fix** — scrubbing and skip-ahead to unbuffered positions now correctly restart HLS transcoding using the video seekable range (not buffered bytes)
- Remove the AC3 / transcoded-audio banner during playback; auto-fallback to transcoded audio still applies silently

## 0.1.24 — 2026-07-03

### Server
- **Transcode resource limits** — cap concurrent FFmpeg jobs at 2, stop stale sessions for the same file, and kill orphan transcoders on startup
- Idle transcode sessions expire after 2 minutes; stale cache dirs are pruned automatically
- Add `scripts/cleanup-cache.sh` for manual transcode/build cache cleanup

### Scripts
- Add `scripts/symlink-media-duplicates.py` to replace duplicate library files with symlinks to torrent copies

- **Dynamic page titles** — tab title updates per page (e.g. movie/show name while watching, library name when browsing)

## 0.1.19 — 2026-07-03

### Playback
- **Seek anywhere while transcoding** — jump to any point in the video, not just the buffered range; in-buffer seeks are instant, far seeks restart transcoding at the new position
- Skip back 10s / forward 30s buttons and arrow-key shortcuts on the watch page

### Chromecast
- **Cast fix** — signed cast tokens let the TV fetch streams without browser cookies (fixes casting when Reel has a password)
- HLS cast uses the correct transcode session and resume position; segment URLs carry auth tokens
- Prefer Mac Wi‑Fi (`en0`) for cast URLs; clearer error messages when cast fails

### In-app updates
- Release notes render as markdown (headings, lists, bold) instead of raw text

## 0.1.18 — 2026-07-03

### Playback
- **Seek during transcoding** — scrubbing and skip-ahead now restart HLS at the correct position instead of staying at the start

- More reliable saves when duration comes from stream info (HLS/transcoding)

### In-app updates
- Update script resets local changes before checking out a release tag on the server

## 0.1.14 — 2026-07-03

### UI
- **Continue** on the home hero picks up your last watched movie or episode (replaces "Play recent")
- Recently added panel uses **Open** to browse titles instead of starting playback

### Playback
- Watch page **resumes saved progress** automatically when you return to something in progress

- Update modal opens automatically and stays visible until the server restarts
- Navbar update chip shows the current step instead of a generic "Updating" label

### UI
- Removed confusing **"Local signal"**, **"Signal online"**, and **"Control room"** copy — plain "Reel" branding and Settings labels throughout

## 0.1.11 — 2026-07-03

### UI
- **Home hero** — "Play recent" starts playback directly; poster art in the featured panel; fewer layout flashes on refresh
- **Plain language** — removed "signal online", "local signal", and other jargon from Home and Settings
- **Search** — navbar bar is the only input; results drop down below as you type
- **Watch page** — new **Details** button shows file name, path, size, codecs, resolution, and playback mode
- Symlinked files show a note and resolved target path in Details

### API
- `/api/home` includes `tmdbConfigured`, library counts, and `recentPlay` watch target
- `/api/stream/:id/info` includes file path, codecs, bitrate, and symlink metadata

## 0.1.10 — 2026-07-03

### UI
- **Layout shift fixes** on Home and Settings — stable skeletons and reserved space while data loads
- **Static page shells** prerender at build time; dynamic content hydrates in client islands (PPR-like with static export)
- **Scroll arrows** on horizontal poster rows (Continue Watching, Recently Added) when content overflows

## 0.1.4 — 2026-07-03

### In-app updates
- **Fixed Update now failing silently** when git remote used SSH — updates now force HTTPS, fall back to clone+rsync, and pass `pnpm` PATH to the update subprocess
- **Update available** button in the navbar opens a modal to start upgrades from anywhere in the app

- **File watcher hardening** — ignores source code, dev folders, and non-media files so large non-media trees (e.g. Go source) won't exhaust inotify watchers or crash the server
- **Scan walks skip** `node_modules`, `.git`, `go1`, and other common dev directories

## 0.1.1 — 2026-07-03
